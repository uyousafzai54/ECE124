This is a collection of labs from ECE 124: Digital Circuits.

* Lab 1 was introduction to VHDL, and design entry methods (Schematic and VHDL)
* Lab 2 we used Muxes and a Seg Segment Decoder to create a 4 bit adder and displayed the results on a FPGA Board
* Lab 3 we also used Muxes and a Seg Segment Decoder to compare the magnitude of two 2 bits numbers. Then we applied this to model a simple Energy Monitoring System for a home on the FPGA Board 
* Finally, in Lab 4, we used all of the components used in Lab 1, 2 and 3 to model a Robotic Arm using Flip Flops, and Mealy and Moore state machines. The FPGA board was used to represent the Robotic arm.
